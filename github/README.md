# 📘 GitHub Learning Series — README

## Why this folder matters

Most GitHub tutorials feel like **slides without a soul** — lists of commands and screenshots that rarely answer the deeper *“why”* or *“what if I get stuck?”* moments. This folder is different. It was built to capture the **confusion, curiosity, and creativity** that real learners face when stepping into GitHub. It's not just for 30-40 million coders, who probably know GitHub, but for a billion people who — if they faced less learning-getting-started-friction — would have started using GitHub.

Every file here is an **interactive micro-lesson**: not just documentation, but a small stage where you can try, observe, and *feel* the workflow. The aim is empathy → teaching GitHub the way a mentor would, not the way a manual does.

## 🔎 What’s inside

* **Confusion Scenarios** → e.g., *Pull vs Fetch*, *Clone vs Fork*, *Rebase vs Merge* — shown as interactive contrasts.
* **Workflow Tutorials** → branching, commits, issues, PR reviews, all framed as step-by-step demos.
* **Quizzes & Checks** → lightweight HTML quizzes that celebrate your answers and explain mistakes.
* **Visual Storyboards** → SVG-based explainers that show GitHub actions as moving stories, not static diagrams.

## 🌐 How it connects

This folder sits inside **Software-Content-Demos**, and links to the wider CMET vision:

* **Content × Experience** → making professional workflows **hands-on**.
* **Content × Marketing** → framing GitHub as an enabler of collaboration.
* **Content × Technology** → showing how pedagogy can live inside a repo itself.

## 🔒 Permissions

These demos are **for discussion, not free-for-all reuse**. If you want to adapt them for training, consulting, or enterprise programs, please reach out to the publisher.

✨ *GitHub learning doesn’t have to be dry. It can be playful, reflective, and memorable — that’s the promise of this folder.*
