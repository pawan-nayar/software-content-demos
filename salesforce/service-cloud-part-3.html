                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>3. Consent Management:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Need:</strong> Custom modules to collect, store, and verify patient consent for data sharing, communication preferences, and treatment plans, often with robust audit trail capabilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Granular permissions for data access, managing varying regional privacy laws (e.g., state-specific consent for sensitive data), and ensuring clear, auditable records of consent capture and revocation. This often involves custom objects and advanced sharing rules.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>4. Clinical Case Types & Triage:</strong>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>5. Secure Messaging & Data Security:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Need:</strong> Encrypted messaging channels for confidential provider-patient and provider-provider communications, with support for attachments and audit logs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Ensuring data encryption in transit and at rest, preventing PHI (Protected Health Information) leakage, managing secure file sharing, and maintaining comprehensive audit logs for all communications to meet HIPAA security rules. This often involves leveraging Salesforce Shield or third-party encryption solutions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="pro-tip danger"><strong>Common Pitfall:</strong> Underestimating the complexity of EHR integration. It's rarely a simple "plug-and-play."
