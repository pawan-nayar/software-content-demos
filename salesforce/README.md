# ☁️ Salesforce Service Cloud & API Demos — README

## Why this folder matters

Most Salesforce documentation is either **too technical for end users** or **too surface-level for admins and developers**. The result? Teams adopt Salesforce, but only partially — with gaps in confidence, friction in onboarding, and lost opportunities for enterprise-wide alignment.

This folder is built to change that. It captures the **moments that matter in enterprise onboarding and daily use**: from Service Cloud basics to hands-on API flows. The goal is empathy for *every role* — helping admins, agents, developers, and managers not just know Salesforce, but actually succeed with it.

It’s not about a billion users; it’s about making **every user in an adapting team** across departments feel capable and empowered — and helping Salesforce itself win space in mindshare and useshare.
