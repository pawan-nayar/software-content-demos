# 📄 Adobe Acrobat Masterclass — README

## Why this folder matters

Traditional Acrobat documentation is either **too fragmented** (scattered help articles) or **too flat** (single-page guides). Users often end up piecing together instructions from forums, YouTube, or peers — wasting time and reducing trust.

This folder is an experiment in **next‑generation enterprise documentation**. Each file is a **standalone interactive micro‑demo**: instead of just telling you *how to combine PDFs*, it shows you — visually, step by step, with built‑in clarity. It demonstrates how even the most common tasks (merge, split, annotate) can be taught with empathy and precision.

The goal here isn’t to rewrite all of Acrobat’s help, but to **show what’s possible**: what documentation could look like if it were rebuilt for today’s enterprise world.
