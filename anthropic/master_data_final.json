This should involve `SUMPRODUCT` or `SUMIFS` with dynamic date criteria and potentially `OFFSET` or `INDEX` to build a rolling window.\n3.  **Predictive Sales Model (Simplified)**: Implement a simple linear regression model (e.g., using `LINEST` array formula or `SLOPE` and `INTERCEPT` in conjunction with a 'what-if' scenario) to project sales for the next quarter based on historical sales data and an assumed growth rate. \n4.  **Interactive Dashboard**: Design a 'Dashboard' sheet that presents key metrics (average churn risk, predicted sales, top 5 highest-risk customers, top 5 highest-selling products) using dynamic formulas linked to the analysis sheets.

                    "userPrompt": "As our lead Excel consultant, design and implement the core formula logic for a new financial forecasting model. The model needs to track actuals vs. budget, project revenue based on a multi-variable growth rate, calculate COGS with variable pricing tiers, and perform sensitivity analysis on key drivers. Ensure all calculations are robust and easily auditable, accommodating quarterly updates and different departmental views. We anticipate complex array formulas, conditional logic, and advanced lookup functions to be essential."
