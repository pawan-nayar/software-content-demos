# 🤖 Anthropic (Claude) Workflows & Training — README

## Why this folder matters

Most AI documentation today is either **API-first** (too technical, assumes coding fluency) or **marketing-heavy** (broad claims, little substance). For real adoption inside enterprises, neither works. Teams need something in between: **practical, role-based, interactive guidance**.

This folder is an exploration of **what that in-between could look like** for Anthropic’s Claude. Each file is designed as a **learning scaffold** — not just docs, but interactive workbenches where people can practice prompting, test workflows, and build intuition.

The goal is not to replace Anthropic’s documentation, but to **show how enterprise enablement could evolve** — teaching AI use not through theory or code snippets alone, but through **hands-on, scenario-driven practice**.

## 🌐 How it connects

This folder illustrates how CMET applies to the AI world:

* **Content × Technology** → building bridges between raw models and human learning needs.
* **Content × Experience** → workflows that people can practice, not just read about.
* **Content × Marketing** → positioning Claude as more than an API — as an adaptable partner for teams.

✨ *AI adoption isn’t about docs alone. It’s about lowering friction, showing real workflows, and giving people confidence. This folder is a prototype of that shift.*
