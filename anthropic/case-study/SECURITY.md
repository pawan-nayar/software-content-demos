Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. **What to Expect**

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Current Implementation

#### Client-Side Security
✅ **No Backend** - All static files, no server vulnerabilities  
✅ **No Authentication** - No user credentials to protect  
✅ **No Database** - No SQL injection risks  
✅ **LocalStorage Only** - No sensitive data stored  
✅ **Input Sanitization** - All user inputs validated  
✅ **XSS Protection** - No `eval()` or `innerHTML` with user data  
✅ **HTTPS Recommended** - Secure transmission in production  

#### Data Privacy
✅ **No Personal Data Collection** - Anonymous usage only  
✅ **No Cookies** - LocalStorage for preferences only  
✅ **No Third-Party Tracking** - No external analytics by default  
✅ **Open Source** - All code is auditable  

#### Content Security
✅ **No External Scripts** - All code is local (except optional CDN for fonts)  
✅ **Subresource Integrity** - If using CDN (add SRI hashes)  
✅ **No `eval()`** - No dynamic code execution  
✅ **Safe JSON Parsing** - Try-catch blocks around all JSON

## 🔐 Best Practices for Deployment

When deploying this project, we recommend:

### Headers to Add

```nginx
# Content Security Policy
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self';

# X-Frame-Options
X-Frame-Options: DENY

# X-Content-Type-Options
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

# Referrer Policy
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

# Permissions Policy
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

### HTTPS Configuration

```nginx
# Force HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
}
```

### Static File Hosting

**Recommended platforms:**
- Netlify (auto-HTTPS, headers support)
- Vercel (auto-HTTPS, edge functions)
- GitHub Pages (auto-HTTPS)
- Cloudflare Pages (auto-HTTPS, CDN)

All provide free HTTPS and security headers.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Not Vulnerable (No Backend)
- ❌ SQL Injection - No database
- ❌ CSRF - No state-changing operations
- ❌ Session Hijacking - No sessions
- ❌ Authentication Bypass - No auth system
- ❌ Server-Side Vulnerabilities - No server code

### Potential Risks (Client-Side)
- ⚠️ **XSS** - Mitigated through sanitization, no `innerHTML` with user data
- ⚠️ **LocalStorage Manipulation** - User can modify their own data only
- ⚠️ **Open Redirect** - No redirects to user-controlled URLs
- ⚠️ **Prototype Pollution** - Avoided through proper object handling
