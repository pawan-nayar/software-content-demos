# 🛠 Best Practices — README

## Why this folder matters

Unlike the other core folders, this one is **small and auxiliary**. It doesn’t aim to carry the same weight as GitHub, Salesforce, or AI Art. Instead, it acts as a **reference shelf** — a place where we capture patterns, habits, and demonstration files that highlight how software content should be built and presented.

The point isn’t to show scale, but to anchor **craft and discipline**: the practices that make interactive documentation more than just demos.

## 🔎 What’s inside

* **Sample tutorials** → showing clarity and simplicity in micro-content.
* **Styling references** → demonstrating mobile-first, accessible UI layouts.
* **Workflow notes** → small examples of how interactivity can reduce friction.

## 🌐 How it connects

This folder complements the big six. Where others show **what** next-gen documentation could be, this one captures the **how** — the reusable patterns and lessons learned.

---

## 🔒 Permissions

These demos are **discussion-first**. They are reference points for building at scale, not templates for direct reuse.

✨ *Best practices are the quiet backbone — not the headline act, but the consistency that makes everything else shine.*
