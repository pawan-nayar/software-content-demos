    p: "Deconstruction & Specificity",
    d: "Break down abstract concepts into their concrete, descriptive components. The AI draws what you describe, not what you feel.",
    steps: [
      "**Define 'Cool':** What does 'cool' look like? Is it a leather jacket, neon lights, a dynamic pose, a smirk?",
      "**List Descriptors:** Write down tangible nouns and actions: `wearing sunglasses at night`, `leaning against a graffiti wall`, `smirking confidently`.",
      "**Rebuild the Prompt:** Combine these specific descriptors. `A South Asian man wearing sunglasses and a leather jacket, leaning against a graffiti wall in a neon-lit alley, smirking confidently at the camera.`"
    ],
    x: "The user will gain precise control over the mood and aesthetic, moving from vague, unpredictable results to intentional, specific imagery.",
    reasoning_layers: [
      { layer: "Context", note: "AI models are trained on image-text pairs; they don't have human emotions or cultural context." },
      { layer: "Observation", note: "Prompts with subjective words like 'beautiful' or 'cool' produce highly variable and often generic results." },
      { layer: "Mechanism", note: "Specific terms force the AI to draw from a more focused set of training data associated with those objects and actions, rather than a broad, generic average." },
      { layer: "Nuance", note: "Some models are getting better at interpreting abstract terms, but specificity always provides more control." },
      { layer: "Situational / Applied", note: "Instead of `sad scene`, describe `a young girl looking out a window on a rainy day, tear tracks on her cheek`." }
    ],
    boundary_conditions: [
      "If a model has been specifically fine-tuned on a certain aesthetic, a single keyword might be very powerful.",

  },
  {
    level: 1,
    q: "My character portraits often have distorted hands or extra fingers. How do I fix this?",
    a: "Use the negative prompt to explicitly forbid common anatomical errors. Hands are complex, and AIs often struggle with them, so guiding the AI away from bad results is as important as telling it what you want.",
    p: "Negative Prompting for Error Correction",
    d: "The negative prompt is a powerful tool for steering the AI away from common failure modes, artifacts, and undesired elements.",
    steps: [
      "**Identify Common Errors:** Observe the recurring problems: extra fingers, twisted limbs, bad anatomy.",
      "**List Negative Keywords:** Create a list of terms that describe these errors: `mutated hands`, `extra fingers`, `deformed`, `malformed`, `bad anatomy`.",
      "**Apply to Negative Prompt:** Add this list to the negative prompt field in your AI art tool.",
      "**Consider a Positive Cue:** Sometimes adding a positive detail like `beautifully rendered hands` can also help."

    reasoning_layers: [
      { layer: "Context", note: "Generative models often struggle with rendering complex, highly variable anatomy like hands." },
      { layer: "Observation", note: "Without negative prompts, a significant percentage of generations have hand deformities." },
      { layer: "Mechanism", note: "The negative prompt removes concepts from the AI's 'solution space'. By telling it to avoid 'extra fingers', you are filtering out potential results that contain that feature." },
      { layer: "Nuance", note: "Overloading the negative prompt with too many terms can sometimes have unpredictable side effects on the rest of the image." },
      { layer: "Situational / Applied", note: "This same principle applies to other common errors, like `watermark`, `text`, `signature`, `blurry`, `jpeg artifacts`." }
    ],

    level: 1,
    q: "I asked for a portrait of a person, but the AI generated a full-body shot from far away. How do I control the camera distance?",
    a: "Use photographic terms that describe camera shots and framing. The AI is trained on millions of photos and understands the language of photography.",
    p: "Camera and Composition Control",
    d: "Using specific photographic and cinematic terminology gives you direct control over the composition, framing, and perspective of your image.",
    steps: [
      "**Learn Shot Types:** Understand the difference between terms like `close-up`, `medium shot`, `full-body shot`, and `extreme close-up`.",
      "**Specify the Framing:** Add the desired shot type to the beginning of your prompt. For example: `close-up portrait of a South Asian girl eating mangoes`.",
      "**Use Lens Terminology:** For more control, specify a lens type, like `85mm portrait lens` for a classic portrait look with a blurry background."
    ],
    x: "You will be able to precisely control the camera's distance and framing, ensuring your subject is presented exactly as you intend.",
    reasoning_layers: [
      { layer: "Context", note: "AI models have a deep 'understanding' of photography concepts from their training data." },
      { layer: "Observation", note: "Without compositional keywords, the AI's choice of framing is often random." },
      { layer: "Mechanism", note: "The term `close-up portrait` is strongly associated with images that are framed from the shoulders up. By using this term, you guide the AI to that specific subset of its training data." },
      { layer: "Nuance", note: "Combining shot types with other compositional terms like `top-down shot` or `side view` provides even more control." },
      { layer: "Situational / Applied", note: "For a dramatic character shot, try `low-angle shot, full-body shot of a boy playing cricket, silhouette against the sunset`." }
    ],
    boundary_conditions: [
      "The effectiveness of these terms can vary slightly between different AI models.",
      "For abstract art, these terms may be less relevant or produce unexpected results."

  },
  {
    level: 1,
    q: "I want to create an image in the style of Van Gogh, but just adding 'by Van Gogh' makes my character look exactly like him. How do I get the style without changing the subject?",
    a: "Use the phrase 'in the style of' or 'painting in the style of' instead of 'by'. This tells the AI to apply the aesthetic (brushstrokes, color palette) without changing the subject's identity.",
    p: "Style vs. Subject Separation",
    d: "The phrasing of your prompt can signal to the AI whether to adopt an artist's style or to depict the artist themselves.",
    steps: [
      "**Start with your subject:** `A vibrant marketplace in Delhi`.",
      "**Apply the style:** Append `in the style of Vincent Van Gogh` to the prompt.",
      "**Describe the style elements:** For more control, you can also describe the style directly: `thick impasto brushstrokes, swirling colors, oil on canvas`."
    ],
    x: "You will be able to apply any artist's aesthetic to any subject you can imagine, unlocking a world of creative combinations.",
    reasoning_layers: [
      { layer: "Context", note: "The AI associates the phrase 'by [artist]' with portraits of that artist or exact replicas of their famous works." },
      { layer: "Observation", note: "Using 'by [artist]' often leads to the subject's face being blended with the artist's face." },
      { layer: "Mechanism", note: "The phrase 'in the style of' is a more nuanced instruction that directs the model to analyze the textural and color properties of the artist's work and apply them to the new subject." },
      { layer: "Nuance", note: "For very famous subjects (e.g., 'Mona Lisa in the style of Picasso'), this technique works exceptionally well." },
      { layer: "Situational / Applied", note: "Try `A futuristic city skyline in the style of Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints`." }

    q: "My images always have a dull, flat lighting. How do I make them look more dramatic and professional?",
    a: "Add specific lighting keywords to your prompt. Just like with camera shots, the AI understands a wide range of lighting terminology from photography and cinema.",
    p: "Lighting Control",
    d: "Describing the light source, its quality, and its direction is one of the most powerful ways to control the mood and professionalism of your images.",
    steps: [
      "**Choose a Light Type:** Is it `soft light`, `hard light`, `studio lighting`, or `natural light`?",
      "**Specify Direction:** Where is the light coming from? `backlighting`, `rim lighting` (for dramatic edges), `side lighting`.",

    reasoning_layers: [
      { layer: "Context", note: "Lighting is a fundamental component of visual art that is well-represented in the AI's training data." },
      { layer: "Observation", note: "Without lighting keywords, the AI defaults to a neutral, evenly-lit scene, which often looks boring." },
      { layer: "Mechanism", note: "The term `rim lighting` is strongly associated with images where the subject has a bright outline, separating them from the background. This keyword guides the AI to that specific visual effect." },
      { layer: "Nuance", note: "Combining lighting terms can create sophisticated effects, e.g., `dramatic backlighting with soft volumetric rays`." },
      { layer: "Situational / Applied", note: "For a child playing, try `golden hour lighting`. For a sci-fi character, try `neon blue rim lighting`." }
    ],
    boundary_conditions: [
      "The effect of lighting terms can be heavily influenced by the chosen artistic style (e.g., a cartoon style will render lighting differently than a photorealistic one).",

    ],
    extra: "Create a prompt that is ONLY about lighting to see how the AI interprets different terms, e.g., `a simple sphere, dramatic lighting`."
  },
  {
    level: 1,
    q: "I generated a great character, but I want to see them in a different setting. When I reuse the same prompt but change the background, the character looks completely different. How do I keep my character consistent?",
    a: "Use the 'seed' value. The seed is the starting number for the random generation process. By reusing the same seed, you tell the AI to start from the same point, which provides a high degree of consistency for the subject, even if you make small changes to the prompt.",
    p: "Seed Locking for Consistency",
    d: "The seed is a key parameter that controls the initial noise pattern of a generation. Fixing the seed allows for iterative refinement and consistent subject generation.",

      "**Reuse the Seed:** In your next generation, paste the copied seed into the 'seed' field.",

    reasoning_layers: [
      { layer: "Context", note: "AI generation has a random element. The seed controls this randomness." },
      { layer: "Observation", note: "Without a fixed seed, the same prompt will produce a different result every time." },
      { layer: "Mechanism", note: "The generation process starts with a field of random noise. The seed determines the exact pattern of that noise. If the starting noise is identical, and the prompt is very similar, the final image will also be very similar." },
      { layer: "Nuance", note: "Making large changes to the prompt can still cause the character to change, even with a locked seed." },

    q: "I see a 'CFG Scale' or 'Guidance' slider in my AI tool. What does it do?",
    a: "The CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) Scale controls how strictly the AI should follow your prompt. A low CFG value gives the AI more creative freedom, while a high value forces it to adhere very closely to your instructions.",
    p: "Prompt Adherence vs. Creativity (CFG Scale)",
    d: "CFG Scale is a parameter that balances the AI's adherence to the prompt against its own creative interpretation.",
    steps: [

      "**For a Balanced result:** The default value, usually around 7-10, is a good balance for most prompts.",
      "**For Strict/Literal results:** Use a high CFG value, like 11-15. This is useful when you have a very specific, detailed prompt and want the AI to follow it exactly."
