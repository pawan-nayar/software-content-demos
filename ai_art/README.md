# 🎨 AI Art Demos

Welcome to **AI Art Demos** — a core folder within **Software-Content-Demos**, showcasing how **AI + pedagogy + interactivity** converge to create powerful learning and creative experiences.

Each file is a **self-contained HTML demo** (HTML + CSS + JS) and can be:

* **Viewed live** via [GitHub Pages](https://pawan-nayar.github.io/software-content-demos/ai_art/)
* **Explored in source** directly in this folder

*This repository is part of the CMET system (Content, Marketing, Experience, Technology), where BeyondDictionary × LLOS.AI explores applied creativity, content engineering, and role-based interactive learning.*

## 🌐 Scope of This Folder

This folder contains **14 interactive demos**. Each one addresses a distinct dimension of AI art — from prompting mastery to workflow design, from parameter exploration to creative pedagogy.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

AI Art is more than visual output — it’s a **learning and content engineering discipline**:

* **Pedagogical depth**: teaching concepts like parameters, prompts, and workflows.
* **Playful interactivity**: flip decks, wizards, practice exercises.
* **Professional relevance**: frameworks that scale to design, gaming, education, and enterprise use.

This folder demonstrates how **role-based learners** — from beginners to advanced designers — can engage with AI art meaningfully.
